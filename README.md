# Smart Trash Sorter (AI + Robotics + Raspberry Pi)

## Project Overview:
This project is an intelligent trash sorting system using computer vision and machine learning. It automatically sorts trash into three categories: recyclable, compostable, and landfill. The system uses a camera to capture images of trash items, which are then classified using a trained machine learning model. The sorting mechanism is controlled using a Raspberry Pi and servo motors.

### Key Features:
- **Image Classification**: Uses TensorFlow and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify trash into categories.
- **Camera Integration**: Uses a camera to capture images of trash items for real-time processing.
- **Sorting Mechanism**: Controls servo motors to direct trash to the appropriate bin based on classification.
- **Hardware**: Powered by Raspberry Pi, integrating a camera and servo motors.

## Tech Stack:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, TensorFlow, NumPy
- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi, Camera Module, Servo Motors
- **Machine Learning**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- **Version Control**: GitHub for repository management
